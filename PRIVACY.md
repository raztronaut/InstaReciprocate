# Privacy Policy for InstaReciprocate

Last Updated: [Current Date]

## Introduction
InstaReciprocate is designed with your privacy as our top priority. We believe in complete transparency: we don't store, collect, or transmit any of your data. Period.

## Local Storage Usage
We use your browser's localStorage to store only one thing:
- Whitelist: A list of usernames you've marked as important to prevent accidental unfollowing
- This data stays in your browser and is never transmitted anywhere
- You can clear it anytime by clearing your browser data

## Zero External Storage Policy
We're proud to say: we store nothing on our servers! Here's what this means for you:
- No servers: We don't have any - everything happens right in your browser
- No databases: Your data exists only in your browser
- No tracking: We don't monitor or track your usage
- No cookies: We don't create or store any cookies
- No analytics: We don't measure or analyze your behavior

## How It Works
1. When you use InstaReciprocate, it temporarily processes Instagram data in your browser's memory
2. Only your whitelist is preserved between sessions (in your browser's localStorage)
3. Everything else is cleared when you close the extension

## What We DON'T Do
We're very clear about this: we don't:
- Store any data on external servers
- Track your usage
- Collect analytics
- Use cookies
- Share anything with third parties
- Keep logs
- Store any preferences (except your whitelist)

## Instagram API Usage
- We only process data during active analysis
- All Instagram API calls are made directly from your browser
- No data passes through any intermediary servers

## Rate Limiting
To protect both users and Instagram's services:
- Rate limits are managed in real-time
- No rate limit data is stored between sessions
- All protections happen in your browser memory

## Your Privacy Rights
Since we don't store any data, you don't need to worry about:
- Data deletion requests
- Data access requests
- Data portability
- Privacy settings

## Changes to Privacy Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy periodically. Users will be notified of any significant changes.
